                        <p> This from-scratch side project began with user research to uncover key pain points in trip planning. Our goal was to design a solution that simplifies the planning process and makes it easier for travel companions to collaborate and enjoy the experience together.</p>

                          <li>Designed the "Travel Playlist" feature to let users quickly apply itineraries by theme, location, or season—boosting planning efficiency by around 30%.</li>
                          <li>Built a cross-platform prototype with a clean, consistent visual style.</li>

                      <p>We conducted in-depth interviews to explore how users plan their trips, the tools they rely on, and the challenges they encounter. Two rounds of interviews were conducted—initially with a diverse range of travelers, and later focusing on experienced solo planners. These conversations helped us gather rich insights into real-world planning behaviors and unmet needs.</p>

                      <p>We translated our interview findings into empathy maps to visualize users' thoughts, emotions, and actions.

                        <h6>Summary of Result:</h6>
                        <p>Users face several challenges during trip planning:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>
                            <strong>Scattered information across platforms</strong><br>
                            Users often search for travel information on platforms like Google, YouTube, and Instagram, then use tools like Google Docs, Google Maps, and Splitwise to organize their plans. Switching between these platforms makes the planning process time-consuming and difficult to manage.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <strong>Poor collaboration and difficulty reaching group consensus</strong><br>
                            During planning, users must prepare multiple alternatives for group discussion. However, it's still hard to meet everyone’s needs, often leading to compromises and frustration.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <strong>Trouble recording and splitting expenses</strong><br>
                            One person is usually in charge of expense tracking, but manual input and calculations can lead to mistakes, forgotten expenses, or misunderstandings.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <strong>Lack of a clear, visual itinerary overview</strong><br>
                            Travel plans are often documented in text format, which makes it hard to grasp multi-day itineraries at a glance—especially when external links (e.g., Google Docs) are used.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <strong>Inflexibility when plans change during the trip</strong><br>
                            Users worry about unexpected changes—such as bad weather or participant dropouts—which can negatively affect the overall travel experience due to a lack of responsive planning tools.
                          </li>
                        </ul>

                      <p>We used insights from the empathy maps to write POV statements that highlight key user problems, like scattered information and hard-to-manage group planning. Then, we turned each POV into "How Might We" questions to help us explore possible solutions and spark new ideas.</p>

                    <p>
                      This project aimed to solve common travel planning problems with a simple and easy-to-use itinerary app. It includes features like tag-based search, templates, shared editing, and real-time updates. One big challenge was choosing which features to keep. At first, we tried to include many functions, but later found that too much made the app harder to use. In the end, we focused on itinerary recommendations to keep things clear and expandable.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Fewer, focused features improve the user experience. Too many can reduce clarity and usability.</li>
                      <li>User testing should check if core features solve real problems, not just what's missing.</li>
                      <li>Familiar design patterns help users understand and use the app more easily.</li>
                    </ul>
